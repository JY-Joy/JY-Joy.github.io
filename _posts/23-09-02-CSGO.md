In this work, we devlop an image stylization model named CSGO, which transfers the style presented by an input reference image to a source image. To enable end-to-end training, we introduce an automatic construction pipeline and IMAGStyle, first large-scale style transfer dataset with 210K {content;style;target}-triplet.
